aboutDropdown2Title: About my research

  My current research focuses on survivors of sexual abuse and the way in which
  gender (i.e., being male, female or gender diverse) affects help seeking
  behaviour and the treatment needs of the individual. The aim of the research
  is to be able to provide gender specific and gender sensitive interventions
  for all persons who experience sexual abuse.


  I also conduct research examining the efficacy of alcohol and drug treatment programmes.
